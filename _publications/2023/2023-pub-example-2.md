  We propose an Aux-ViT model for Alzheimer's diagnosis using MRI that adds an auxiliary branch to the Vision Transformer backbone to preserve shallow features and reduce overfitting, achieving improved accuracy over the baseline ViT model through multi-scale data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
