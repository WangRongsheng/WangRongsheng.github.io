abstract: >-
  We introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM designed for advanced medical reasoning. It identifies mistakes, explores alternative strategies, and refines its answers by leveraging a specialized medical verifier. The model enhances reasoning through two key approaches: guiding complex reasoning trajectories for fine-tuning with the verifier and applying reinforcement learning (PPO) with verifier-based rewards to further improve reasoning.
